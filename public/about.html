			<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hi my name is Jolon Tong and I made this website mainly because I have a passion for football. With this passion comes with what many people play which is Fantasy Football. This blog 
					is about talking strategy as well as to provide information about particuliar players and matchups. People will be able to bounce ideas between one another to hopefully become the champion of their 
					league. Please leave me any feedback under the contact section. Thank you and enjoy the website.
